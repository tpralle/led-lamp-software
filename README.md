# LED Lamp Software

LED Lamp Software is made to run serial controlled LEDs used in a friends lamp projects.

I will be updating and adding features as requested. Please open an issue with any features you would like to see added.

## Installation

Depends on the [FastLED library](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/blob/master/LICENSE).

Open the led-lamp-software.ino file in an arduino ide, compile and upload to compatable boards.

## Usage

Cycles the color of the LEDs of the lamp in a rainbow pattern.
Allows the use of a knob to control overall lamp brightness.
